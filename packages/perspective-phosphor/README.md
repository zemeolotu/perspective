# Perspective Phosphor Extension

This extension implements `perspective-viewer` in a [PhosphorJS](https://phosphorjs.github.io) widget, making it trivial to integrate perspective in `phosphor` based apps, such as JupyterLab. 

## Installation

### From npm
`npm install @finos/perspective-phosphor`
